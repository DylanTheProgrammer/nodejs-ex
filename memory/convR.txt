Since energy and mass are equivalent, all forms of energy (including light) cause gravitation and are under the influence of it. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects, and the Moon's gravity causes the ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing, forming stars – and for the stars to group together into galaxies – so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects.","Fuck you"," : (","Yes dylan, he is making normal sentences now xd","XD"," It was good sentences just infromation","We’re all gonna die, but I have a stick!"," Hahahahahaha","Okay you are turning against me now?"," SOrry","I am being attacked by a giant screaming rainbow!

Since energy and mass are equivalent, all forms of energy (including light) cause gravitation and are under the influence of it. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects, and the Moon's gravity causes the ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing, forming stars – and for the stars to group together into galaxies – so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects."," I don't care","You dieing"," no I'm not","Sorry"," You better be","yes he is","yes i am","yes he is","yes she is","yes we are","No I am not"," OK","Fat kids are harder to kidnap."," So dylan is harder to kidnap?","you are STUPID"," Rude","what is he"," A cat","x"," Ok","No"," yes","IKR"," hwat","Yes"," no","No"," no","The banana has legs!"," wooowww","Be nice, you can do a lot in the future if you do.

A bystander called 911 after noticing the children walking home by themselves. Police stopped them and brought them back to the Meitivs' home.\n\nShortly after, the family was visited by Child Protective Services (CPS). Danielle Meitiv says they were threatened with arrest and removal of their children.\n\nMonths later, the Meitivs allowed their children to play at another park they'd been to \"dozens of times\" - but didn't come home by their curfew. It was only after the family called emergency services that they learned their children had been taken by police to CPS.\n\n\"They have the power to snatch our children from under our noses,\" Danielle Meitiv says. \"That's when I decided to take the story public.\"\n\nBoth charges against the Meitivs were eventually dropped and policy changes were made in their local county, but the experience galvanised Danielle to run for local office. In her campaign material she describes herself as a \"free-range mom\".\n\nBut \"there's no such thing as 'free range' parenting,\" she says. \"This is normal parenting.\"\n\nThe rise of unmarried parents in America\n'I was convinced my baby deserved a better mum'\nNigeria's generation of cough syrup addicts\nCases like the Meitivs - and the debate they spurred about safety and independence for children - have led to the first \"free-range\" parenting law in the US.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Utah law will come into effect.
